I expect to learn a lot of new things in CMSC 100 that will help me flourish as a developer, I expect to learn more skills in collaboration that will enable me to work with other people for small and bigger projects that will allow me to become an important member of a group. I also expect to learn a new programming language through React JS which will even further enhance my skills as a developer and provide more opportunities in the future.

I agree with the statement.
